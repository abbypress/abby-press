		<i> <blockquote> Welcome to New Amsterdam's Haunted Theatre! </blockquote> </i>
	
	<!-- this is the paragraph abput the theatre. it tells how it is haunted and what it
	is used for --> 
	
	<p>  New Amsterdam Theatre is currently preforming Aladdin at the time! While watching
	 Aladdin you may see a little something running across stage. Thats Olive Thomas 
	 who died in 1920, and haunts the theatre to this day! Sometimes she is seen
	  gliding across stage blowing kisses to the audience. 	New Amsterdam theatre is also
	  broadways home for disney shows/musicals. Another perk of the theatre is that you 
	  can rent out the theatre for events. </p>

	 my son pointed out to me the ghost running back and forth on the stage during
